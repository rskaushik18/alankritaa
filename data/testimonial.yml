            "They did a superlative job artistically but more than that, their calming presence was so wonderful. I was a jittery, overly chatty and very fidgety bride but they patiently saw the whole exercise through."

            "They did my bridal henna, and what an Incredible job they did. Being a henna fan all my life, my wedding mehandi was so important to me, and it was the best decision to go with Alankritaa by Rashi. From spending time to conceptualizing the design to the final day, it had been a smooth smooth ride with Rashi. Something us bridezilla's really need. The final stain of the henna was fab too."

            "Since I am not from Delhi, we decided everything over the phone and WhatsApp but I was not scared or skeptical because I knew she would do a great job! She sent me her rough sketches and ideas over WhatsApp and then we just decided to go with the flow. In the middle of the mehendi I requested for a change and addition and she happily did it with a huge smile on her face! The mehendi turned out to be STUNNING and something I will cherish all my life!"

            "As every other bride, I too wanted to do something different when it came to my mehendi and so she made it happen. Thanks to her, I had everything I wanted. From brainstorming with me till finalizing each and every element… making the ten thousand changes that I kept asking her to do and patiently dealing with my demands... she was just brilliant with everything. My mehendi had a little bit of me, a little bit of tradition and a lot of love. I recommend her a 100% and more."

            "We went back and forth a lot when it came to designing my mehndi and it was perfect. I was very concerned about not getting color on the back as I usually don’t and I even suggested may be using colored chemicals and all but Rashi assured me that it will all be fine and I shouldn’t worry. And she was right. My Mehndi turned out more than perfect. Highly recommend her. She will make your mehndi dreams come true."

            "Their work is extremely neat and so intricate that you just instantly fall in love with their designs. I wanted a simple and elegant design for my mehendi and they created something perfectly aligned with what I wanted. They were extremely punctual and reached early in the morning to start. I wanted to get my makeup done while getting the mehendi put and they were extremely accommodating throughout."
